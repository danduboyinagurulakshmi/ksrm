            <h3>About the Physical Activities</h3>
            <p>Physical education is a part of general education and it is an education to prepare the student to be healthy 
                and robust. Generally we imagine that physical education is meant only for developing the person’s physique i.e. perfect shape of the body.
                But the physical education is much beyond this. It is meant to develop a knowledge of an individual to develop the physical well being and
                prevent physical diseases as well as mental problems and maintain a good personality. It can help to cut unwanted fat and make the body
                sculpt. It also deals with exercises to prevent many mental problems like stress, anxiety, anger etc., 
                through the knowledge of Yoga. The motto of physical education is to inculcate this all people and create a disease free nation.</p>
